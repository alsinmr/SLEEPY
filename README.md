# SLEEPY
Spins in Liouville space for rElaxation and Exchange in PYthon

Currently under development. Requires standard python packages plus numpy/scipy/matplotlib.

Under development should be taken seriously. Please contact me if you want to publish something using SLEEPY sims, so I can at least check that everything is valid for the simulations.

Known issues:
Quadrupole relaxation is probably incorrect/incomplete.

Relaxation towards thermal equilibrium occurs with a fixed value. For a spin that the equilibrium polarization varies throughout the rotor period, this will not be correct (relevant for DNP, and effects such as pseudocontact shift in solid-state NMR).
